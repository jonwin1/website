      <description>&amp;ldquo;dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.&amp;rdquo; - suckless.org
This post talks about my dwm configuration and the changes I have made to it.
Patches alwayscenter: &amp;ldquo;All floating windows are centered, like the center patch, but without a rule.&amp;rdquo;
attachbottom: &amp;ldquo;New clients attach at the bottom of the stack instead of the top.&amp;rdquo;
center first window: Adds rule to center window if it is the only client in a tag.</description>

      <description>My many attempts at creating a more optimal keyboard layout for my self. So far all of the layouts have been used on a normal TKL keyboard, but with the latest layouts the goal has been to create a layout that would work on a Charybdis by Bastard Keyboards. See the cover picture for how the keys have been moved around to make the latest layout work on a normal keyboard.</description>

This is my configuration of the suckless terminal st. I have installed a few different patches and made some configuration changes to improve the usability and look of the terminal.
Try My Config To try my configuration on any system with Nix installed run the following:
nix run github:jonwin1/st-jonwin Patches Srollback: Allow scrolling back through the terminal output using keybinds or the mouse wheel.</description>

      <description>I created this website to have a single place to document all my projects and share them. It will also serve as a kind of portfolio that shows what things I have worked on and learned.
This Website This website was build with Hugo which is a open-source static site generator, Hugo allows you to generate posts like this one from markdown files. I use the PaperMod theme for my site, it is a clean and simple theme with many useful features.</description>
