<h2 id="this-website">This Website<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#this-website">#</a></h2>
<p>This website was build with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> which is a open-source
static site generator, Hugo allows you to generate posts like this one from
markdown files. I use the <a href="https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod">PaperMod</a>
theme for my site, it is a clean and simple theme with many useful features.
I have made one simple modification to the theme which is to add a last modified
date like described by <a href="https://www.jacksonlucky.net/posts/use-lastmod-with-papermod/">Jackson Lucky</a>.
The date will only appear if the post has been modified since it was posted and
it will automatically update using the files Git history to know when the post
was last modified.</p>
<h2 id="create-your-own-website">Create Your Own Website<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#create-your-own-website">#</a></h2>
<p>You could either clone my <a href="https://github.com/jonwin1/website">repo</a> and modify
it to fit your needs or follow this <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">guide</a>
to create your own.</p>
<h3 id="using-my-repo">Using My Repo<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#using-my-repo">#</a></h3>
<p>To use my repo as the base of your own website do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-zsh" data-lang="zsh"><span class="line"><span class="cl">git clone https://github.com/jonwin1/website
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">cd</span> website
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">git submodule update --init --recursive <span class="c1"># Clone submodules (the theme)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">hugo server -D <span class="c1"># Start development server with drafts</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The pages are located in the <code>/content/</code> directory with the exception of the home
page which is configured in <code>config.yml</code> <em>(I have chosen to change the hugo.toml
to config.yml since many tutorials and examples I looked at used yaml and
recommended it as easier to read)</em>. Once the server is started you can open the
website at the address shown in the therminal, usually <a href="http://localhost:1313/">localhost:1313</a>.</p>
<p>If you intend to use my repo for your own website I recommend removing all files
from <code>/content/posts/</code> and creating your own posts, then remove my pictures from
<code>/content/pictures.md</code> and <code>/static/</code> and replace them with your own. Lastly
modify <code>config.yml</code> to use your own url, title, homepage content, logo, etc.</p>

<h3 id="deploying">Deploying<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#deploying">#</a></h3>
<p>I have used Cloudflare Pages to deploy my website and I would recommend it to
others since it is very easy and free. Cloudflare has a good <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-hugo-site/">guide</a>
on how to deploy a Hugo site using Cloudflare Pages, this guide also contain
some instructions on how to create a hugo site.</p>
<p>Hosting your site this way is very simple because once it is configured you
only need to push changes to your git repo and then the website will be updated
with the changes automatically.</p>
<p>If you own a domain name you can configure your website to use this domain instead
of the <code>*.pages.dev</code> address provided by Cloudflare, to to this follow this
<a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/custom-domains/">guide</a>.
If your domain is already managed by Cloudflare this is very easy and Cloudflare
