[{"content":"I created this website to have a single place to document all my projects and share them. It will also serve as a kind of portfolio that shows what things I have worked on and learned.\nThis Website This website was build with Hugo which is a open-source static site generator, Hugo allows you to generate posts like this one from markdown files. I use the PaperMod theme for my site, it is a clean and simple theme with many useful features. I have made one simple modification to the theme which is to add a last modified date like described by Jackson Lucky. The date will only appear if the post has been modified since it was posted and it will automatically update using the files Git history to know when the post was last modified.\nCreate Your Own Website You could either clone my repo and modify it to fit your needs or follow this guide to create your own.\nUsing My Repo To use my repo as the base of your own website do the following:\ngit clone https://github.com/jonwin1/website cd website git submodule update --init --recursive # Clone submodules (the theme) hugo server -D # Start development server with drafts The pages are located in the /content/ directory with the exception of the home page which is configured in config.yml (I have chosen to change the hugo.toml to config.yml since many tutorials and examples I looked at used yaml and recommended it as easier to read). Once the server is started you can open the website at the address shown in the therminal, usually localhost:1313.\nIf you intend to use my repo for your own website I recommend removing all files from /content/posts/ and creating your own posts, then remove my pictures from /content/pictures.md and /static/ and replace them with your own. Lastly modify config.yml to use your own url, title, homepage content, logo, etc.\nFor more info on how to create posts and more view the Hugo documentation, some other good sources of information are the PaperMod wiki and this post by Jesse Wei.\nDeploying I have used Cloudflare Pages to deploy my website and I would recommend it to others since it is very easy and free. Cloudflare has a good guide on how to deploy a Hugo site using Cloudflare Pages, this guide also contain some instructions on how to create a hugo site.\nHosting your site this way is very simple because once it is configured you only need to push changes to your git repo and then the website will be updated with the changes automatically.\nIf you own a domain name you can configure your website to use this domain instead of the *.pages.dev address provided by Cloudflare, to to this follow this guide. If your domain is already managed by Cloudflare this is very easy and Cloudflare takes care of almost everything, otherwise you might have to add some DNS records manually.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/this-website/","summary":"I created this website to have a single place to document all my projects and share them.
